        "Imagine if you can turn music into chewing gum? Hmmm, yeah, your Samuraï Koala think he can do it... He worked so much his sound martial arts he became very elastic !
        "
        - 1. Understand the time-stretching
          - Time-stretching is a digital audio effect whose purpose is to shorten or lengthen the duration and/or tempo of a sound recording without changing its pitch.
        - 2. Find the time stretch function
          - { PICS }
          - Open the sample editor by clicking "EDIT" and navigate with the arrows until you find "STRETCH"
        - 3. Activate time stretch 
          - { PICS }
          - Click "Stretch", you can now see a new field with red background at the top of the waveform.
          - Once the time stretching activated, the looping points (start/end) of your sample sticks to your project BPM.
        - 4. Set a time stretch duration
          - To let Koala calculate the time-stretch, you have to define a stretch duration sample, the basic unit is the BEAT, and a BAR is 4 beats of course !
          - The time stretch duration represents how long you want your sample to play.
            "Note : Remember, now your sample stick to the project bpm."

      "Koala is a powerful yet easy to use sequencer. It allows you to create up to 32 patterns.
      The pattern lenght is up to 64 bars, so you can litterally compose hours of music ! 
      The sequencer is really high resolution.

        "
        - 1. What is a pattern ?
          - A pattern consists of a grid on which you can place events (triggers) that you can play in loop.
            "Note : With Koala you can record patterns but you'll need the "Piano Roll" function to see the grid, this is available with the #SAMURAÏ extension.
            "
          - { PICS } / image of a pattern grid
          - All pattern have a lenght (1 BAR, 2 BARS, etc...) and a number of beats/bar (2, 3, 4, 5, etc...).
          - { PICS } / image of a pattern grid containing events 
          - When you record a pattern, playing pads will place triggers in the grid. A soon as the pattern reach its looping point, your hear what you recorded.
        - 2. Record / play a pattern

        - The piano roll is basically an editor where you can write your pattern or correct it. 
        - It consist of a grid representing your pads vertically (or your notes if you're in "KEYBOARD" mode) and the time horizontally (your bars and beats).
        - The grid is generally called a step sequencer. It illustrate a 1/16 quantization, so 16 steps per BAR, but you can also place events anywhere you want.
        - You can put your triggers in the grid and give them behaviors after.
      - 5.5.3. Piano Roll - Step sequencer
        - 1. Add / delete events in the step sequencer
          - {PICS} 
          - To add an event, simply click on the grid where you want your sample triggers. To help you, beats and steps divisions are displayed.
          - Remember the columns represents the pads (or the notes in "KEYBORD" mode) and the rows represents the time (bars). 
          - {PICS}
          - To delete an event, just click on it.
        - 2. Event field

          - Event types
            - Trigger - trigger a note
            - Velocity - adjust velocity on a trigger
            - Chance - add a triggering chance to a trigger
        - 3. Snap to grid (Quantization)

          - Click "SNAP" to open a drop-down menu, then select your quantization.
          - {PICS} 
          - Toggle ON "snap end" if you want the event lenght to be the same as the quantization when you record live.
        - 4. Adjust the velocity

          "
          - {PICS} 
          - Click "VEL" in the event field, now you can slide the events to adjust velocity.

          - {PICS} 
          - Click "CHANCE" in the event field, now you can slide the events to adjust the triggering chance between 0% and 100%.
            "Note : chance is illustrated with a dice pictogram.
            Note 2 : Yeah it's a kind of weird action putting an event in the grid and give it 0% chance to trig... Maybe a proof that koala's god himself isn't perfect.

    - MAREK SAYS: I agree, I tried to sort it out but kind of broke it again - its on my todo list
  - + Adding pattern lenght in BPM popup to group it with beat per bars -
    - MAREK SAYS: I think this would make it too hidden - its better where it is
    - Q says: Not necessary to remove it from the general interface.
  - + Adding the setting value anywhere the user has to slide in the UI
    "Helping to understand what we do and doing better settings.
    "
    - MAREK SAYS: you mean making the settings easier to get to by a gesture? It's a possibility, just not sure how useful it would be
    - Q says: Yes, if you want to set the same filter on differents samples, knowing the value would be helpful.
  - + Adding a 440hz signal in SAMPLE, available both in monitoring and in editing: -
    "Helping tuning the sample or record in tunes (singing)
    "
    - MAREK SAYS: this would be cool but not sure how to put it in the UI without getting in the way.
    - Q says : I’ll think about that 😁
  - When naming a song (after recording a live song) --> display the name of current Koala song
    - MAREK SAYS: I'm not sure what this means exactly
    - Q says : If I use « record song », when I finished, before exporting, I have to name the song. If i don’t remember the name of my koala song, I have to put a random name. Displaying the name is just a reminder.
